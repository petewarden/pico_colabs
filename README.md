## Summary

This is a small collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to help newcomers to the Raspberry Pi Pico platform build programs, without having to install any development tools on their local machine. To get started, I'd recommend [clicking on this link to run the Blink notebook on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/petewarden/pico_colabs/blob/main/Building_Blink_for_the_Raspberry_Pi_Pico.ipynb).
